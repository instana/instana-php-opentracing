# Instana OpenTracing for PHP

A PHP implementation of the OpenTracing interfaces for usage with Instana.

## Requirements

Requires an Instana Agent running at the configured  InstanaSpanFlusher  endpoint. By default,
traces will be sent to the PHP sensor's trace acceptor listening on port 16816 on any network
interface on the host machine. If no PHP sensor is running on the machine receiving the traces,
consider using the alternative REST SDK endpoint. To do so, set the global tracers as follows:

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTracer;

\OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::set(InstanaTracer::restSdk());
```

Using the restSdk tracer will send traces to the endpoint in the agent listening on port 42699.

Starting with v2.0.0 the minimum PHP version required is PHP 5.4.
The 1.x branch will only work on PHP 7+.

## BC breaks between the 1.x version and the 2.x version

The methods `InstanaSpanType::entry()`, `InstanaSpanType::local()` and `InstanaSpanType::exit()`
have been renamed to `InstanaSpanType::entryType()`, `InstanaSpanType::localType()` and
`InstanaSpanType::exitType()` to provide compatibility with PHP < 7. Direct invocations of these
methods in your code will need to be renamed.

## Installation

This library is available on Packagist.

```bash
composer req "instana/instana-php-opentracing:^2.0"
```

You can include it manually in your composer.json like this:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "instana/instana-php-opentracing": "^2.0"
    }
}
```

Because OpenTracing v1.0.0 is still in beta, you will also need to set

```json
{
    "config": {
        "prefer-stable": true,
        "minimum-stability": "beta",
    }
}
```

Otherwise, Composer will refuse to install the package.

## Example usage

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTracer;

\OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::set(InstanaTracer::getDefault());

$parentScope = \OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::get()->startActiveSpan('one');
$parentSpan = $parentScope->getSpan();
$parentSpan->setTag(\Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTags\SERVICE, "example-service");
$parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\COMPONENT, 'PHP simple example app');
$parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND, \OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND_RPC_SERVER);
$parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\PEER_HOSTNAME, 'localhost');
$parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_URL, '/php/simple/one');
$parentSpan->setTag(\Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTags\HTTP_PATH_TPL, '/php/simple/{id}');
$parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_METHOD, 'GET');
$parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_STATUS_CODE, 200);
$parentSpan->log(['event' => 'bootstrap', 'type' => 'kernel.load', 'waiter.millis' => 1500]);

$childScope = \OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::get()->startActiveSpan('two');
$childSpan = $childScope->getSpan();
$childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND, \OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND_RPC_CLIENT);
$childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\PEER_HOSTNAME, 'localhost');
$childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_URL, '/php/simple/two');
$childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_METHOD, 'POST');
$childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_STATUS_CODE, 204);

$childScope->close();
$parentScope->close();

\OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::get()->flush();
```

## Containerized applications

When instrumenting a containerized app, you will need to provide the endpointURI to point to the
agent running the container, e.g. for sending traces to the PHP Sensor you instantiate the tracer with

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTracer;

InstanaTracer::phpSensor('tcp://172.17.0.1:16816');
```

For sending traces to the REST SDK, you instantiate the tracer with

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTracer;

InstanaTracer::restSdk('http://172.17.0.1:42699/com.instana.plugin.generic.trace');
```

Adjust the URI to whatever URI allows communication from the container to the host.

## Support for 3rd party libraries

### AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service) context injection and extraction

When using `aws/aws-sdk-php` in your application, you will probably want to connect the dots.

The shipped class `\Instana\OpenTracing\Support\SQS` enables you to inject the current context
into the raw message passed to `\Aws\Sqs\SqsClient::sendMessage()` and extract it from messages
received via `\Aws\Sqs\SqsClient::receiveMessage()`.

To wrap the `sendMessage` command, call `SQS::sendMessage`:

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\Support\SQS;

SQS::sendMessage($sqsClient, $message);
```

To wrap the `sendMessageAsync` command, call `SQS::sendMessageAsync`:

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\Support\SQS;

SQS::sendMessageAsync($sqsClient, $message);
```

Receiving a message and continueing from there is equally easy:

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTags;
use Instana\OpenTracing\Support\SQS;
use OpenTracing\Tags;

$result = $sqsClient->receiveMessage([
    'AttributeNames' => ['SentTimestamp'],
    'MaxNumberOfMessages' => 1,
    'MessageAttributeNames' => ['All'],
    'QueueUrl' => $queueUrl, // REQUIRED
    'WaitTimeSeconds' => 0,
]);

if (!empty($result->get('Messages'))) {
    $message = $result->get('Messages')[0];
    $context = SQS::extractContext($tracer, $message);
    $scope = $tracer->startActiveSpan('sqs', [
        'child_of' => $context,
    ]);

    $span = $scope->getSpan();
    $span->setTag(InstanaTags\SERVICE, 'php-consumer');
    $span->setTag(Tags\SPAN_KIND, Tags\SPAN_KIND_MESSAGE_BUS_CONSUMER);
    $span->setTag(Tags\MESSAGE_BUS_DESTINATION, $queueUrl);

    // ..do your thing..

    $scope->close();
}
```

Or even easier:

```php
use Instana\OpenTracing\Support\SQS;

$message = []; // receive your raw message from SQS
$scope = SQS::enterWithMessage($message, function($message) use($myOtherService) {
    // work the message as you like
    $myOtherService->work($message);
});
```
