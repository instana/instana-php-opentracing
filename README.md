# instana-php-opentracing

A PHP implementation of the OpenTracing interfaces for usage with Instana.

## Requirements

Requires an Instana Agent running at the configured  InstanaSpanFlusher  endpoint. By default, 
traces will be sent to the PHP sensor's trace acceptor listening on port 16816 on any network
interface on the host machine. If no PHP sensor is running on the machine receiving the traces, 
consider using the alternative REST SDK endpoint. To do so, set the global tracers as follows:

        \OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::set(InstanaTracer::restSdk());
        
Using the restSdk tracer will send traces to the endpoint in the agent listening on port 42699.

Starting with v2.0.0 the minimum PHP version required is PHP 5.4.  
The 1.x branch will only work on PHP 7+.

## BC breaks between the 1.x version and the 2.x version

The methods `InstanaSpanType::entry()`, `InstanaSpanType::local()` and `InstanaSpanType::exit()` 
have been renamed to `InstanaSpanType::entryType()`, `InstanaSpanType::localType()` and 
`InstanaSpanType::exitType()` to provide compatibility with PHP < 7. Direct invocations of these 
methods in your code will need to be renamed.

## Installation

This library is available on Packagist. You can include it in your composer.yml like this:

    "require": {
        "instana/instana-php-opentracing": "^2.0",
        "opentracing/opentracing": "^1.0.0@beta",
    }
    
Because OpenTracing v1.0.0 is still in beta, you need to specify the version of this dependency.
Otherwise, Composer will refuse to install the package.

## Example usage

    \OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::set(InstanaTracer::getDefault());

    $parentScope = \OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::get()->startActiveSpan('one');
    $parentSpan = $parentScope->getSpan();
    $parentSpan->setTag(\Instana\OpenTracing\InstanaTags\SERVICE, "example");
    $parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\COMPONENT, 'PHP simple example app');
    $parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND, \OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND_RPC_SERVER);
    $parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\PEER_HOSTNAME, 'localhost');
    $parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_URL, '/php/simple/one');
    $parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_METHOD, 'GET');
    $parentSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_STATUS_CODE, 200);
    $parentSpan->log(['event' => 'bootstrap', 'type' => 'kernel.load', 'waiter.millis' => 1500]);

    $childScope = \OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::get()->startActiveSpan('two');
    $childSpan = $childScope->getSpan();
    $childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND, \OpenTracing\Tags\SPAN_KIND_RPC_CLIENT);
    $childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\PEER_HOSTNAME, 'localhost');
    $childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_URL, '/php/simple/two');
    $childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_METHOD, 'POST');
    $childSpan->setTag(\OpenTracing\Tags\HTTP_STATUS_CODE, 204);

    $childScope->close();
    $parentScope->close();

    \OpenTracing\GlobalTracer::get()->flush();
 
## Containerized applications

When instrumenting a containerized app, you will need to provide the endpointURI to point to the
agent running the container, e.g. for sending traces to the PHP Sensor you instantiate the tracer with

    InstanaTracer::phpSensor('tcp://172.17.0.1:16816');

For sending traces to the REST SDK, you instantiate the tracer with

    InstanaTracer::restSdk('http://172.17.0.1:42699/com.instana.plugin.generic.trace');

Adjust the URI to whatever URI allows communication from the container to the host.
